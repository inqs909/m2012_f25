### Course Description

Critical reasoning using a quantitative and statistical problem-solving approach to solve real-world problems. Uses probability and statistics to describe and analyze biological data collected from laboratory or field experiments. Course will cover descriptions of sample data, probability and empirical data distributions, sampling techniques, estimation and hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and correlation and regression analysis. Students will use standard statistical software to analyze real world and simulated data. GenEd: 2

### Learning Outcomes

-   Prepare students for advanced courses in data-management and statistics
-   Reason both inductively and deductively with quantitative information and data
-   Use statistical software for complex statistical analysis of real-world and simulated data
-   Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems
-   Write the results of a statistical study and draw conclusion in reports

#### Participation

Participation is based on short writing assignments conducted in class. There will be no make ups for these writing prompts.

#### Notebook Assignments

Notebook assignments are designed to expand your statistical knowledge. These will be completed in Google Colab which can be accessed from Canvas. There is one notebook assignments every week that you can be completed during class time. Notebook assignments will be due on Thursday at 11:59 PM every week. The 3 lowest notebook assignments will be dropped.

#### Video Assignments

Videos are used to teach statistical concepts related to the course. Students are expected to watch at least one video a week. The videos are implemented using VoiceThreads. The 3 lowest video assignments will be dropped. Video assignments will be due every Sunday at 11:59 PM.


#### Exams

There will be three in exams. Exam #1 will be on September 29, 2025, Exam #2 will be on November 3, and Exam #3 will be on . While the exams are not considered cumulative, the material builds on each other. Developing a strong understanding of the material through out the course is important for your success. At the end of the semester, your lowest exam grade will be replaced by your median average of all 3 exam grades. This course will operate under a zero-tolerance policy. Talking during the time of the exam, sharing materials, looking at another students' exam, or not following directions given will be subject to the University's academic integrity policy.


#### Extra Credit

There will be **4** extra credit opportunities worth a total of 10% of your overall grade. (There are no make-ups for missed extra credit assignments!) More information will be provided on the extra credit assignments on a later date. Information on the extra credit can be found [here](ec.html).

### University Policies

1.  **Academic Honesty**:

    Conduct yourself with honesty and integrity. Do not submit others' work as your own. For assignments and quizzes that allow you to work with a group, only put your name on what the group submits if you genuinely contributed to the work. Work completely independently on exams, using only the materials that are indicated as allowed. Failure to observe academic honesty results in substantial penalties that can include failing the course.
