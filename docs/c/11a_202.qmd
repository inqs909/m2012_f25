## Linear Regression

-   Fitting Models

-   Interpreting Results

    -   Numerical Predictors
    -   Categorical Predictors

-   Prediction

## Logistic Regression

-   Fitting Models

-   Interpreting Results  

    -   Numerical Predictors
    -   Categorical Predictors

-   Prediction


## Regression

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Linear Regression**

- Outcome is a number

:::

::: {.column}
**Logistic Regression**

- Outcome is 2 categories

:::
::::

## Outcome versus predictors

Read the problem carefully

## Linear Regression

Interpret the slope as is!

## Logistic Regression

Exponentiate the slope an interpret the odds ratio!

## Identify Data Type

Use the `glimpse()` function.

## Numerical Predictor

Interpret as a regular math slope.

::: callout-note

### Interpretation

As x increases by 1 unit, y increases/decreases by an **average** of **b** (coefficients) units
:::

## Categorical Predictor

Interpret slope in comparison to reference category.

::: callout-note

### Interpretation

When the category is x, y is an average of **b** units higher/lower than the reference category.  

:::

## Common Mistakes

- Using the incorrect model

- Incorrect interpretation
